Here are several more examples of IO-bound workloads:

	Indexing
	Grouping
	Data importing and exporting
	Data movement and transformation

Here are several more examples of CPU-bound workloads:

	Clustering/Classification

Hardware tipico de un Data Node 

Here are the recommended specifications for DataNode/TaskTrackers in a balanced Hadoop cluster:

12-24 1-4TB hard disks in a JBOD (Just a Bunch Of Disks) configuration
2 quad-/hex-/octo-core CPUs, running at least 2-2.5GHz
64-512GB of RAM
Bonded Gigabit Ethernet or 10Gigabit Ethernet (the more storage density, the higher the network throughput needed)

Here are the recommended specifications for NameNode/JobTracker/Standby NameNode nodes. The drive count will fluctuate depending on the amount of redundancy:

4–6 1TB hard disks in a JBOD configuration (1 for the OS, 2 for the FS image [RAID 1], 1 for Apache ZooKeeper, and 1 for Journal node)
2 quad-/hex-/octo-core CPUs, running at least 2-2.5GHz
64-128GB of RAM
Bonded Gigabit Ethernet or 10Gigabit Ethernet
